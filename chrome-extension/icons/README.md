# Icons Folder

This folder should contain extension icons. For now, icons are optional.

If you want to add icons, create PNG files with these sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

You can create simple icons using:
- Online tools: favicon.io, canva.com
- Design software: Figma, Photoshop
- Or use emoji as placeholder: 📚 (book emoji for learning app)
